            Most people know me as a cyclist. Others know me as a bearded
            backpacker trying to navigate a bus schedule. My family knows me as
            an outgoing and socialable man who loves being with family and
            friends. All of these are true and all have a special place in my
            heart. My life has taken many twists and turns, with most of them
            unanticipated. I'm lucky that each turn has taught me a great deal
            about myself and I've been able to teach others along the way as
            well.

            Web development has provided me with a wonderful outlet to create.
            After my wife and I were married we decided that we wanted to
            explore the world and take a risk. We embarked on a 10-month,
            multi-country journey through South East Asia. To make sure our
            family knew we were safe, I made a website for us to document our
            trip. I loved being able to share information quickly and explore a
            creative side that I didnâ€™t know was there. I find a lot of
            enjoyment working through challenges, creating elegant designs, and
            exploring avenues to continue to learn.

            I'm sure that the path my life is on will take different turns and
            detours. The challenges that life presents makes things interesting
            and exciting. One constant I know I'll have is a life centered on
            creating.
